Apache TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.
TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.

Getting Started
---------------
Check out the [TVM Documentation](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/) site for installation instructions, tutorials, examples, and more.
The [Getting Started with TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorial/introduction.html) tutorial is a great place to start.


TVM SETUP ON HOSTPC FOR TE0802
-----------------------------
1. Clone the repository
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/eamicheal/tvmTE0802 tvmTE0802

2. Next modify the according entries, and then compile by
$ cd tvmTE0802/build
/tvmTE0802/build$ cmake ..

3. Next modify the according entries, and then compile by
/tvmTE0802/build$ make -j8

4. export Variables (in the terminal OR in ~/.bashrc)
export TVM_HOME=/home/xxxxx/tvmTE0802
export PYTHONPATH=$TVM_HOME/python:${PYTHONPATH}
export VTA_HW_PATH=$TVM_HOME/3rdparty/vta-hw
export PYTHONPATH=$TVM_HOME/vta/python:${PYTHONPATH}

5. Setup and activate Conda Env
$conda env create --file conda/build-environment.yaml
$conda activate tvm-build

6. Install and check python dependencies
$ cd tvmTE0802
$ cd python; python3 setup.py install --user; cd ..

7. Run Test
$ cd tvmTE0802
$ python3 /vta/tutorials/frontend/deploy_classification.py


Contribute to TVM
-----------------
TVM adopts apache committer model, we aim to create an open source project that is maintained and owned by the community.

Acknowledgement
---------------
We learned a lot from the following projects when building TVM.
- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): Part of TVM's TIR and arithmetic simplification module
  originates from Halide. We also learned and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.
